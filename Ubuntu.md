Installed VirtualBoxOracle
Installed ubuntu 22.04.3 64bit
upon finishing installation, i wandered around the new OS
then used the famous linux terminal and tried:
1. "nautilus": a command which opened the file manager
2. "lsb_release -a": a command that showed the ID, ReleaseDate, CodeName of installed Ubuntu
3. "df": a command that showed the disk space usage
4. "top": a command showed a menu similar to TaskManager on windows
5. "pwd": a command that showed current directory
6. "ls": a command which listed current files in the dir
7. "cd": a command used to change between dirs
8. "touch HelloWorld.txt": a command used to create a text file named HelloWorld
9. "sudo apt install vim": a command used to install vim
10. "vim HelloWorld.txt": a command used to access file using vim to edit it 
11. "cat": a command used to display contents of the file
I conclude the markdown here but i continued exploring this new environment, experimenting with it and having fun :).
